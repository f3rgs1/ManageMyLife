# ManageMyLife
A very basic tool to organise tasks, breaking down by day, week and month as well as tracking basic productivity.

The idea behind this project is to provide a single, cross-platform, portable FOSS app that can be used to manage, track and enhance productivity. This will be achieved by way of a number of central features;

-Interactive calendar to visualise projects and tasks and manage them effectively.
-Tags to categorise tasks by project, priority and/or nature.
-Button to change timescale for tasks
-CRUD task management system using basic SQLite database.
-Point accrual for Completed tasks, persistent across sessions.


Additionally, a number of desirable features will be added when possible, these will be;

-Animations and Styling
-API support
-Cloud backups and User Accounts
